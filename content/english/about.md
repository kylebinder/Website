description: Why a website?
title: About
---

This site serves as my professional profile. I plan to use it as a creative outlet for musings and pet projects on economics, statistics, sports, food, any combination of these topics, or anything else that catches my eye.


I do my best to use economics and statistics to answer (only sometimes) important questions. My tool of choice is R. I live in Chicago, IL with my wonderful wife and two children. Much of the content on this site is likely tinged with my passion for Chicago sports teams, cycling, and urban design.


This site was assembled using [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/kylebinder/Website).
