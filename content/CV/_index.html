<h2>Profile</h2>
<p>I am a quantitative analyst with a versatile skillset lying at the intersection of statistics, economics, and data science. I have experience working with relational databases, building production-level econometric and statistical models, developing analytical tools used by colleagues (including software packages and applications), and publishing research in peer-reviewed academic journals. I earned a B.S. from Centre College and a Ph.D. from Texas A&amp;M University, where I focused on time series econometrics and energy-related empirical economics issues.</p>
