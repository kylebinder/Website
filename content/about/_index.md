This site serves as my personal professional website. I plan to use it as an outlet for some musings and pet projects on economics, statistics, sports, food, any combination of these topics, or anything else that catches my eye.

<br>
I do my best to use economics and statistics to answer (only sometimes) important questions. My tool of choice is R and I am an avid fan of [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). I live in Chicago, IL with my wonderful wife. Much of the content on this site is likely tinged with my incessant passion for the Bears, Bulls, Cubs, and Illinois Fighting Illini basketball.
